Installing Topdrop extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the extension directory

3. Activate the extension using the eZ publish admin interface 

4. Patching the pagelayout.tpl
   In order have the CSS Dropdown menu working with IE 8, the css_dropdown extension include an override template for page_head.tpl
   This template include
       <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7">
   To force IE 8 to work as IE 7

5. Clear the cache....

6. Tune your menu.
   Each fetch has a filter like class_filter_array, array(1)
   This will only display folders
   In eZwebin, replace by class_filter_array, array(1,19,20,31) to get all needed classes.

   This parameter can be configured level by level

   Overflow direction
   A multi level menu on the right of a webpage might go out of the screen. To prevent it, topdrop has a parameter that tell the sub menu if it should expand on the left or on the right
   In settings/design.ini.append.php you will find a goleft setting
   goleft=4 means that the first 4 menu will drop on the right, while the next will drop on the left.
