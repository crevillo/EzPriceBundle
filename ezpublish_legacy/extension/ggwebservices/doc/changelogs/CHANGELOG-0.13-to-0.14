Changes from 0.13 to 0.14 - released 2013/7/20

NB: new php classes added. Please regenerate autoloads when upgrading!

*Added:

- compatibility with the eZ Publish REST API v2!
  Implemented both in the php layer and in the debugger (using REST type).
  For best results, use the json variant of all the calls for now.

- make the webservices/execute view respect ValidateClientIPs even when server
  is behind a reverse proxy (needs eZP 4.5 or later and config in site.ini)

- debugger always displays status code, charset, content-type for all execute calls (REST first!)

- all the response classes now save http headers in $this->headers() when decoding
  a payload. This makes it easier to execute further processing, eg. support custom
  authentication schemes

- methods ggWebservicesClient::getOption() and ggWebservicesClient::availableOptions()

- new methods in class ggRESTRequest to set Accept header, or any custom header for that matter

- example code to interact with eZPublish REST API v2 in doc/samples

- the template fetch function webservices/call has a new parameter. When set, the response object
  is returned instead of just the data

* Changed

- REST requests will happily receive a plaintext or html response without trying to decode it.
  This makes it easier to use them for interacting with sites (posting to forms etc)

- ggWebservicesClient::setOptions throws an exception when trying to set an invalid option

- it is possible that, when servers do not specify it, the charset of a response now defaults to empty whereas it defaulted to UTF-8 before

*Bugfixes:

- avoid strict errors with eZP5 LS

- make the debugger work correctly when testing the current server by using the
  admin siteaccess and plain php session handler

- all types of responses properly set their content-type, status code and charset on decoding

- debugger: only allow user to set content type when request has a body
