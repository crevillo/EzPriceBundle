eZ Network Client installation instructions
============================================

------------
Introduction
------------

If you have any problems while installing, please read the eZ Network FAQ in the doc/ directory before contacting the
eZ representative.

See the definitions at the end of this file, if you have problems understanding the instructions.

IMPORTANT: If you are attempting to install eZ Network on a copy of a site, please refer to section "Installing a on a
duplicate site"


------------
Requirements
------------

These are the requirements for the eZ Network extension:
* Official eZ Publish Enterprise requirements (http://ez.no/ezpublish/requirements)
* Access to GNU patch command (required for manual patching)
* Outbound connection access to critmon1.ez.no:443 (required for monitoring)


------------------
Installation steps
------------------

1. eZ Network extension Setup
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cluster note: In the case of cluster setup you have gotten a set of pre-configured ez_network extensions for the
              specific nodes involved in the cluster.

1.1 The tarball must be extracted in the "extension/" directory.
    The tarball will override the directory "ez_network/".
    Remember to remove the "ez_network/" directory before you extract the files, if it already exists.

1.2 Enable the extension by adding it to the ActiveExtension list in settings/override/site.ini.append.php
    [ExtensionSettings]
    ActiveExtensions[]=ez_network

1.3 Regenerate autoload array
    Check the eZ Publish docs for your version on how this is done.
    Or go to Setup -> Extensions and click on the button there.



2. Initialize the eZ Network application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Alternative: You can skip step #2 and #3 by instead using web installer available on "Service Portal" tab in admin gui.

This script will initialize the database ( create the necessary database tables ), and log MD5 sums of eZ Publish files
to the database ++. You should have received a predefined installation key (a string of 32 characters), if not contact
your ez representative.

2.1 From ezroot, run the script "extension/ez_network/scripts/initialize.php" with the --installationkey parameter like:
    php extension/ez_network/scripts/initialize.php --installationkey=<installation_key>



3.Set up the cronjobs
+++++++++++++++++++++

Cluster note: 'sync_network' & 'monitor' cronjobs should only execute on the master server.

The initialize (2.1) script created a file called nw_crontab.txt that contains the list of cronjobs that must be set up.
You may modify the intervals as you choose but please follow these recommendations:

3.1 sync_network � updates the client with the latest data.
    This cronjob part will download and install the latest monitors from ez.no. It will also sync information about
    patches (but not install them). This cronjob can for example be run every 8 hours. ( 24:00, 08:00, 16:00 )

3.2 monitor � runs the monitor, and uploads the result to support.ez.no (via critmon1.ez.no)
    The results of the monitor is uploaded to support.ez.no once all the monitors have been run. If the upload fails,
    it'll try to upload the result the next time. This cronjob can be run every 5 minutes.

Note:
That the sync_network cronjob has to be run successfully before the other crons will work.
If you ran the initialize script with a key provided to you, then you should be able to connect to the eZ Network system
right away.



On *nix platforms:
------------------
To access the cronjob list (crontab), execute the command "crontab -e -u [crontab user]".
For more information about the crontab, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab.


On Windows platforms:
---------------------
To access the Windows task scheduler interface, following this sequence:
Start->All Programs->Accessories->System Tools->Scheduled Tasks
For more information on how to use it, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Tasks


--------------------------------
Installing a on a duplicate site
--------------------------------

If you are setting up a copy of a site that is already running eZ Network,
you have to remove the eZ Network Installation ID from its database before you run the eZ Network cronjobs.
The Installation ID has to be unique per installation.

Typical situations where you want to install eZ Network on a copy of a web site, is staging servers, test servers, live
servers, and so on.

This is where you locate and remove the Installation ID:

1. Access your database
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Refer to the manual for your database.


2. Locate the Installation ID
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Select value from ezsite_data where name='ezpublish_site_id';
+----------------------------------+
| value                            |
+----------------------------------+
| 3ac8afd225280b93be31e93f953bdb51 |
+----------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)


3. Remove the Installation ID+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Delete from ezsite_data where name='ezpublish_site_id';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)

Now you can start the installation process, which will provide you with a unique Installation ID.
